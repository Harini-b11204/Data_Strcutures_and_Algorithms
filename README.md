## 📁 File Structure

```bash
📦 Java-DSA
├── ARRAYS/               # One-dimensional and multi-dimensional array problems
├── BINARY_SEARCH/        # Classic and advanced binary search problems
├── BIT_MANIPULATION/     # Bitwise logic and optimization techniques
├── MATRIX/               # 2D matrix traversal, transformation, and pathfinding
└── STRINGS/               # String manipulation and pattern-matching problems
```
Each folder contains:

🔹 Java implementations of common and advanced problems

🔹 Explanatory comments and edge case handling

🔹 Gradual difficulty levels (Easy → Medium → Hard)

## 🛠️ How to Run
Make sure you have Java installed. Then:
```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

## ✨ Why This Repo?
